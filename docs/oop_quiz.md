"Object Oriented Programming Quiz
To pass the quiz, you must correctly answer at least 18 of the 20 questions below.

1.

What serves as the blueprint for creating objects?

Classes
Functions
Variables
Loops
2.

Which module does Python use to implement abstract classes?

Random
abc
xyz
Time
3.

What defines the data and behaviors of an object?

Seeders and databases.
Functions and classes.
Variables and loops.
Properties and methods.
4.

What is single inheritance?

A child class inheriting properties and methods from multiple functions.
A child class inheriting properties and methods from a single class.
A child class inheriting properties and methods from multiple classes.
A child class inheriting properties and methods from a single function.
5.

Which of the following is NOT one of the key principles of object-oriented programming?

Encapsulation
Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
Abstraction
Inheritance
6.

What is the difference between prefixing attributes and methods with a double underscore and single underscore?

Single underscore means private, double underscore means protected.
Single underscore makes them public, double underscore makes them static.
Single underscore is just a convention for internal use, double underscore triggers name mangling to prevent accidental attribute and method overriding.
Single underscore hides the attribute completely, double underscore makes it readable only inside methods.
7.

Which OOP concept lets you hide complex implementation details and only shows the essential features of an object or system?

Inheritance
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
8.

Which decorator do you use to create a setter?

@<property_name>.setter
@<method_name>.creator
@<property_name>.creator
@<method_name>.creater
9.

Which OOP concept lets you hide the internal state of the object behind a set of public methods and attributes that act like doors?

Polymorphism
Single inheritance
Encapsulation
Abstraction
10.

What is a getter?

A method that deletes an attribute from an object.
A method that retrieves or returns the value of an attribute.
A method that creates a new attribute in an object.
A method that updates or changes the value of an attribute.
11.

What is a setter?

A method that sets or updates the value of an attribute.
A method that retrieves the value of an attribute.
A method that deletes an attribute from an object.
A method that deletes the value of an attribute.
12.

What lets you delete a value you set and get with a setter and getter?

Delayer
Remover
Eraser
Deleter
13.

What promotes code reuse, provides clear hierarchies, and allows customization of behavior without rewriting everything?

Abstraction
WET
Inheritance
DRY
14.

Which of these is the correct syntax of inheritance?

class Parent:
    pass
class Child(Inheriter):
    pass
class Parent:
   pass
class Child(Parent):
   pass
class Parent:
    pass
class Child(InheritParent):
    pass
class Child:
   pass
class Parent(Parent):
   pass
15.

What connects setters and getters?

Properties
Classes
Functions
Methods
16.

What is the process by which Python internally renames an attribute prefixed with a double underscore by adding an underscore and the class name as a prefix?

Abstraction
Name Mingling
Name Mangling
Polymorphism
17.

Which function lets you invoke a method from a parent inside a child class?

__init__()
super()
property()
constructor()
18.

Which of the following statements best describes polymorphism in OOP?

It allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
It allows different classes to use the same method name while performing different actions when called.
It allows a class to have multiple constructors with different properties and methods.
It allows creating objects with the class keyword.
19.

Why does Python mangle the name of an attribute prefixed with double underscores?

To prevent accidental attribute and method overriding in subclasses when using inheritance.
To automatically convert attributes into read-only properties.
To improve performance by storing attributes more efficiently.
To make the attribute completely private and inaccessible from outside the class.
20.

Why are properties used instead of methods for getters and setters?

To allow direct attribute-like access with dot notation for better readability.
To make code longer and more explicit.
To prevent access to the value entirely.
To automatically log every value change."
