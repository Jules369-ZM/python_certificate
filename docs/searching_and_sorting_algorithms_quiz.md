Searching and Sorting Algorithms Quiz
To pass the quiz, you must correctly answer at least 9 of the 10 questions below.

1.

Which search algorithm iterates through a list of items, checking each item from the beginning until the target item is found?

Merge search
Linear search
Binary search
Bubble search
2.

Which technique is used to break down a problem into smaller sub-problems?

Divide-and-solve
Divide-and-conquer
Break-down-and-conquer
Break-down-and-solve
3.

What is the space complexity of the linear search algorithm?

O(n²)
O(n)
O(1)
O(log n)
4.

Which is more suitable for a larger list of items between binary search and linear search?

Linear search
None
Both
Binary search
5.

What is the space complexity of binary search?

O(log n)
O(n)
O(1)
O(n log n)
6.

What does the binary search algorithm return when it finds the target item?

A boolean value of the target.
The size of the list searched.
The index of the target item.
The value of the target item.
7.

What does the linear search algorithm return if it doesn't find the target item?

-1
0
Undefined
Null
8.

How does the merge sort algorithm work?

It recursively splits the list into smaller items, then merges them in sorted order.
It swaps adjacent elements until the list is sorted.
It builds a sorted list by repeatedly finding the smallest element.
It searches for an element by checking each item one by one.
9.

What is the condition for a binary search to work?

The list must be sorted in ascending order.
The list must contain no negative numbers.
The list must be sorted in descending order.
The list must contain only unique values.
10.

Which computer science approach is used to implement the merge sort algorithm?

Divide-and-conquer
Tracing
Dynamic programming
Greedy algorithm
