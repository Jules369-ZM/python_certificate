# Python Certification Projects (FreeCodeCamp)

This repository contains my completed projects for the FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python certification. Each project demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts, including data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and practical problem-solving skills.

## Overview

The FreeCodeCamp Python certification covers a wide range of topics from basic programming to advanced concepts. These projects were built to reinforce learning through hands-on implementation of various algorithms and applications.

All projects are written in Python 3 and include:
- Complete implementations
- Test suites to verify functionality
- Instructions for running and using the code
- Documentation explaining the concepts and approaches

## Projects Included

### Algorithms & Data Structures
- **Caesar Cipher**: Implementation of the classic encryption algorithm with command-line interface
- **Hash Table**: Custom hash table implementation with collision handling
- **Linked List**: Complete singly-linked list data structure with workshop steps
- **Tower of Hanoi**: Recursive solution to the classic puzzle problem

### Object-Oriented Programming
- **Polygon Area Calculator**: Shape classes (Rectangle, Square) with area/perimeter calculations
- **RPG Character**: Character creation and management system
- **Player Interface**: Player data handling with interfaces
- **Game Character Tracker**: Advanced character statistical tracking
- **Musical Instrument**: OOP representation of musical instruments

### Practical Applications
- **Budget App**: Personal finance and expense tracking application
- **Email Simulator**: Email system simulation
- **Medical Data Validation**: Patient record validation system
- **Config Manager**: Configuration file management utility
- **Discount Calculator**: Product discount computation tool
- **ISBN Validator**: Book ISBN validation and checking
- **Media Catalogue**: Media library organization system
- **Number Pattern**: Pattern generation algorithms
- **Pin Extractor**: PIN code extraction utility
- **Planet**: Astronomical object modeling
- **Salary Tracker**: Employee payroll management

### Documentation
- **Python Basics Review**: Comprehensive study guide covering Python fundamentals
- **Algorithms & Big O**: Time and space complexity analysis
- **Data Structures Documentation**: Linked lists, stacks, queues, hash maps, sets
- **OOP Review**: Object-oriented programming concepts
- **Problem Solving Techniques**: Advanced algorithmic thinking

## How to Use

Each project is contained in its own directory with:
- Source code files (`.py`)
- Test files (`test_*.py`)
- Documentation (`README.md` or `steps.md` for guided implementations)
- Usage examples and instructions

To run a project:
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Follow the specific instructions in that project's README
3. Typically run: `python main.py` or `python test_*.py`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies required (all projects use built-in Python libraries)

## Learning Outcomes

Through completing these projects, I gained proficiency in:
- Python syntax and semantics
- Data structure implementation and analysis
- Algorithm design and optimization
- Object-oriented design principles
- Test-driven development
- Command-line applications
- Error handling and input validation
