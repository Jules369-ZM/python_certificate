Pin Extractor Workshop - Steps Summary

Step 1: Create the basic function structure.
- A function called pin_extractor with parameter 'poem'.
- Add an empty return statement (pass or just close the function).

Step 2: Initialize the secret code.
- Inside the function, create a variable secret_code initialized to an empty string.

Step 3: Set up debugging environment.
- Outside the function, create a poem variable with the given multi-line string.
- Add a function call with the poem variable as argument (later to be replaced with print for debugging).

Step 4: Split the poem into lines.
- Inside the function, split the poem into a list of lines using split('\n').
- Assign to a variable called 'lines'.

Step 5: Loop over the lines.
- Create a loop over the lines list (initially with print(line) inside).

Step 6: Split lines into words.
- Inside the line loop, split each line into words using split().
- Print the words list for debugging.

Step 7: Use enumerate for line indices.
- Change the loop to use enumerate(lines) to get line_index and line.
- Update print to show line_index and line.

Step 8: Extract word at line index.
- Change print to print(words[line_index]).

Step 9: Get length of the word.
- Change to print(len(words[line_index])).

Step 10: Convert length to string.
- Change to print(str(len(words[line_index]))).

Step 11: Build the secret code.
- Replace print with secret_code += str(len(words[line_index])).

Step 12: Remove debug prints and add return.
- Remove the print(line_index, line).
- Add return secret_code at the end.

Step 13: Add print for debugging output.
- Change the function call to print(pin_extractor(poem)).

Step 14: Handle missing words.
- Add if statement to check if line_index < len(words) before accessing words[line_index].
- Otherwise, append '0'.

Step 15: Add else for missing words.
- Add else clause to append '0' when line_index >= len(words).
- Update the poem to have a line with missing word for testing.

Step 16: Add more poems for multi-poem extraction.
- Add poem2 and poem3 to the global scope.
- Comment out the print(pin_extractor(poem)).

Step 17: Make the function handle multiple poems.
- Change the parameter from 'poem' to 'poems'.
- Add a for loop around the existing body to iterate over poems.
- Update the print call to use [poem, poem2, poem3] and uncomment it.

Step 18: Prepare for returning multiple codes.
- Create secret_codes list at the start of the function.
- Append secret_code to secret_codes instead of returning early.
- Return secret_codes at the end of the loop.

Step 19: Finalize the multi-poem function.
- Ensure returns secret_codes (now a list).
- The commented/uncommented print remains as setup for testing.

The pin_extractor function is now complete and can extract PINs from multiple poems at once, returning a list of PIN strings.
