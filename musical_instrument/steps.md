# Musical Instrument Workshop Steps

## Step 1
Create a class called MusicalInstrument. Add pass as the body of the class for now.

## Step 2
Inside your MusicalInstrument class, add an __init__ method with three parameters: self, name, and instrument_type.

## Step 3
In the __init__ method, assign the name parameter to self.name and the instrument_type parameter to self.instrument_type.

## Step 4
Outside the class definition, create an instance named instrument_1 for an Oboe which is a woodwind instrument.

## Step 5
Create a second instance named instrument_2 for a Trumpet which is a brass instrument.

## Step 6
Print the name and instrument_type attributes of both your instances.

## Step 7
Remove the existing print calls.

## Step 8
Define another method named play with only the self parameter inside the MusicalInstrument class.

## Step 9
Inside your play method, use print() to display a message about playing the instrument. Use an f-string to include the instrument's name: The [instrument name] is fun to play!.

## Step 10
Add another method named get_fact that returns a fact about the instrument. It should return an f-string: The [instrument name] is part of the [instrument type] family of instruments.

## Step 11
Call the play() method on your instrument_1 instance.

## Step 12
Call the get_fact() method on instrument_1 and print the result.

## Step 13
Call play() on instrument_2 and print the result of get_fact() on instrument_2.
